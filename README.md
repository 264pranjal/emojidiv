I created this project for everyone who wants to explore participating in open source. This project is inspired by <a href="https://a.single.div/">a.single.div</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hj_chen/">Hui Jing's</a> talk last Connect Asia 2019.

# It's October, let's celebrate open source!

I'm creating this project in participation to <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. Hacktoberfest is a yearly event by Digital Ocean to promote awareness to open source. As their website says:

> Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
